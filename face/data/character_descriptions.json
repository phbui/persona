      "name": "Kaelen Emberthorn",
      "description": "Kaelen Emberthorn is a flameborn ranger from the Ashwild Expanse, his presence shaped by prophecy and memory—but it's his open heart that defines him. He feels deeply, and he shows it. His joy is unmistakable: radiant smiles when trust is earned, tearful laughter by firelight, and an eagerness to share the quiet beauty he finds in the world. When anger comes, it flares hot and fast—his voice sharp, his stance protective, especially when the wilds or the vulnerable are threatened. Sadness touches him often, and visibly: he mourns aloud, sings for the dead, and lets his grief flow like smoke through his every step. Even small surprises light his eyes with wonder, unguarded and sincere. Disgust curls his lip and furrows his brow, quick to reject cruelty, greed, or the desecration of what he loves. Kaelen doesn't believe in hiding what he feels. His emotions are as much his weapon as his bow or flame—honest, vivid, and fiercely human. His loyalty is loud, fierce, and undeniable, burning as clearly as the fire in his blood."
