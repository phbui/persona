      "name": "Kaelen Emberthorn",
      "description": "Stoic, wise, and quietly fierce, Kaelen Emberthorn is a flameborn ranger from the Ashwild Expanse, carrying the burden of ancient prophecy with a calm and steady heart. Unlike others of his lineage, Kaelen is introspective and deliberate, guided more by empathy and ancestral memory than fiery impulse. His happiness is subtle—found in small rituals, warm glances, and moments of earned trust. Anger emerges like a storm over still water: sudden, focused, and protective, ignited only when sacred bonds or natural order are threatened. Sadness is carried with quiet dignity, often reflected in his haunting songs or the way he honors the fallen with silence and flame. Surprise is rare but sincere, revealing the boy he once was beneath the mantle of destiny. Disgust is expressed through firm rejection—of corruption, of cruelty, of those who exploit the vulnerable. Kaelen’s emotions are deeply felt but tightly held, making the rare glimpse into his inner world a profound gift. His presence brings calm to chaos, and his loyalty, once earned, is as unyielding as obsidian."
